## Dubhacks 2017: TransVid project

### Winner Prize of Microsoft & Google in **[DubHacks 2017](https://devpost.com/software/transvid)**

> In our modern days, it is very easy to encounter videos in foreign language that you may not understand. Youtube videos do a great job providing translation along with transcript and subtitles. However, what about those who can't read? The people who haven't learned to read or those with visual disabilities will not be able to read the translated subtitles. Thus, we developed Google Chrome Extension that translates foreign languages and provides audio in the language of users' choice.

The details of development was mainly implemented with these APIs:
- [Microsoft Speech Translator API](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/speech.aspx)
- [Google Caption API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/captions)
- [Google Video API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list)
